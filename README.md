# Excel Finance Models

This repository contains a collection of Excel workbooks demonstrating advanced financial modeling, accounting analysis, and data visualization. These models were developed to apply core finance concepts in practical, real-world scenarios.

## üìÇ Contents

### üìä Capital Budgeting Models
- **NPV, IRR, and Leverage Analysis**
  - Compares multiple projects based on projected cash flows.
  - Calculates Net Present Value (NPV) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR).
  - Includes leverage analysis to assess risk and return.
- **Capital Budgeting Scenarios**
  - Evaluates project alternatives under Optimistic, Expected, and Pessimistic scenarios.
  - Supports decision-making with scenario-based forecasts.

### üí∞ Financing Decision Model
- Assesses financing alternatives considering cost of capital, risk premiums, and expected cash flows.
- Calculates risk-adjusted NPV to inform investment and funding decisions.

### üßÆ Cost of Capital Model
- Prepares structured Balance Sheets and Income Statements.
- Computes Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) and evaluates capital structure.

### ‚è≥ Time Value of Money (TVM) Models
- **Time Value of Money Calculations**
  - Computes Present Value (PV) and Future Value (FV) of annuities and lump sums.
  - Uses PMT functions and discounting formulas.
- **PVF, CVF, PVAF, CVAF Tables**
  - Presents standard factors used in time value of money analysis.
  - Supports consistent, repeatable calculations.

### üìà Data Analytics and Customer Satisfaction
